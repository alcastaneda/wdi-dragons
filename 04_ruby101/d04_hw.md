## 4.4 Weekend Homework

#### Read, Read, Read

Research and read Ruby books. [You can view our recommendations here](05_ruby101/README.md). We highly recommend either **Learn Ruby the Hard Way** or **Ruby Monk** if you do not purchase Sandi Metz's *Practical Object Oriented Ruby*. You know what content is giving you problems... so go out and research them!

#### Project 1... Live!

* Create a brand new Github repository for your first project (the game).
* Create a Sinatra server.
* Host your game using **ERB View(s)** and placing your scripts/styles in the **/public/** folder.
* Deploy it to Heroku!
* To submit for completion, in the `05_ruby101/your_name` folder create a file called `weekend-hw.md`. Inside of it, link to your repository and live website URL.
* If you run into Heroku issues please at minimum link to your repository.
