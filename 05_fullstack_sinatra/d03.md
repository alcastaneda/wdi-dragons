*Welcome back! Hopefully you're stuffed full of delicious food from Thanksgiving! Leftover turkey sandwiches, anyone? Today we're going to connect SQL databases to Ruby. To do this, we'll create Models and utilize a tool called ActiveRecord.*

**Objectives**:
* Instantiate and create a new instance of a Model using ActiveRecord
* Query a model to read it using ActiveRecord
* Edit a model's attributes ActiveRecord
* Destroy a model using  ActiveRecord

#### Controllers and Routing

*We're going to discuss routing and controllers. By the end of this lesson, you will have learned to create dedicated controllers for each model.*

**Objectives**:
* Understand the purpose of a controller (to collect information from models and then render the view)
* Create controllers in Sinatra for various Models
* Render the data from a Controller into a View
