## 5.3 Homework

#### Shopping List Wireframes

* Complete the Shopping List Wireframes morning exercise
* Prepare to use these during the week as we work on a Shopping List application!

#### My First CRUD App

You're to create an application of your own! This can be anything you want! However, you must meet the following technical requirements:

* Migrations file should be created and tested. It should contain **three** tables.
* A simple Sinatra application that contains **three** controllers.
* Each controller must correspond to a specific model.
* Each controller must render a View that lists **all** of the rows in a table.
* Each controller must render an API that lists **all** of the rows in a table to JSON.

Get creative! You'll create this application in your `05_fullstack_sinatra/your_name/my_first_crud/` folder.
