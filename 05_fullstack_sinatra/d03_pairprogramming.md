## 5.3 Pair Programming Lab

**Build it together!** In a new repository called `sinatra_coupons`

1. You're going to build a Coupon application using Sinatra MVC
2. You'll need a database!
3. And a table for Coupons attributes like `title`, `description`, `product`, `discount_price`, `expiration_date`
4. You'll also need to create a **migrations.sql** file.
5. Now, using ActiveRecord and Sinatra - create an MVC app that lists out all of the coupons.
6. Utilize controllers to accomplish this!

*Notes*

- You should have an `ApplicationController`, `HomeController`, and `CouponsController`
- You'll also need a `CouponsModel`
