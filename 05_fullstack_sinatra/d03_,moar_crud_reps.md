## 5.3 MOAR REPS with Sinatra's Songs

We need *moar reps*. Let's run through our basic **MVC** process again before jumping into full CRUD actions tomorrow. Tonight, inside of `05_fullstack_sinatra/your_name` create a new folder called `sinatra_songs`.

1. We need a database to store songs!
2. Songs have `artist` and `title`. Perhaps even a `release_year`?
3. Let's create a `Songs` table to store them.
4. Now that we know this works, create a `migrations.sql` to store the connection/creation information regarding our database.
5. Once our database is all set, create an application in Sinatra!
6. This application should render all of the `songs` in our table on a page.
7. Utilize Controllers, Models (and ActiveRecord) and Views (ERB) to render them out!
8. Create a pull request once everything is up-and-running!
